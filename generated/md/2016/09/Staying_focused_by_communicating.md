Title: Staying focused by communicating

Recently I have been thinking about how my productivity tends to vary a lot depending on some
arbitrary context. It tends to change a lot between projects or even between different points of time
for the same project, which often results in jumping between various small things continuously
without ever getting anything big done.

At the same time it somehow has never been an issue at my daily job despite the fact it is about
almost the same technological stack (and even kind of projects) as my hobby stuff. If anything, it
somehow was an issue to switch from the work projects to something else!

It seems I have found an answer and it surprised me a lot - feels like the key to my engagement in
a project is being able to work on it as part of a team. It wouldn't be that surprising normally but
I am quite infamous for being rather asocial person :) But no matter if I actually collaborate in
writing code or simply have someone interested in same project to regularly discuss related topics,
it makes a great difference in my ability to stay focused.

With that in mind I probably can't call myself a geek anymore - because a true geek is supposed to
get enough fun and passion from technology itself, with no concerns if it is relevant or applicable
to anything or anyone :)
